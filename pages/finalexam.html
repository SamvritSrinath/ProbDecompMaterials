          <h2>Game Design: Top-Down Decomposition</h2>
          <p>
            In this question, we are describing a programming problem that we
            might want to solve, but we are not interested in the actual code.
            Instead, we are interested in the function decomposition of this
            problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re interested in designing a text-based game where a player
            battles monsters.
          </p>
          <p>The player and monster each have their own values for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Strength</b>: how strong they are</li>
            <li><b>Health</b>: their current health level</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The general flow of the game consists of the following: the player
            battles a monster, visits the store, battles the next monster,
            visits the store again, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            The player wins the game if they defeat 10 monsters (win 10
            battles). The player loses the game if their health goes to 0.
          </p>
          <p>
            To battle a monster, the game first decides on the strength and
            health of the next monster. The monster strength and health is
            random but based on the total number of monsters that the player has
            defeated (this way the monsters get more difficult as the game
            progresses).
          </p>
          <p>
            The player and monster take turns, and the battle continues until
            the player or monster loses (has 0 health).
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              On each of the player’s turns, they can either do:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  a weak attack that is guaranteed to hit the monster and will
                  do damage (reduce health of monster) based on the player’s
                  strength.
                </li>
                <li>
                  or the player can do a strong attack that is less likely to
                  hit, but will do more damage to the monster.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              The monster then attacks (the strength of its attack is based on
              the monster’s strength value). The player's health is then
              decreased by this amount.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the player loses the combat, the game ends. If the player
              defeats the monster, they earn money (more money for more
              difficult monsters), and then they return to the store where they
              are automatically healed, meaning that their health goes back up
              to full health.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>At the shop, players can buy from the merchant.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The merchant offers a random selection of goods that either
              increase player health or player strength.
            </li>
            <li>
              The cost and benefits of the merchant’s goods are related to the
              number of monsters defeated, but with some random variation.
            </li>
          </ul>

              <li>
                The player needs money to buy items, so
                <code>current_money</code> is essential.
              </li>
              <li>
                The player's <code>current_strength</code> and
                <code>current_health</code> are needed to display their stats
                and show the effects of purchased upgrades.
              </li>
              <li>
                The problem states that the "cost and benefits of the merchant’s
                goods are related to the number of monsters defeated," so
                <code>monsters_defeated</code> is a necessary parameter to
                generate the shop's inventory correctly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Passing a <code>list_of_monsters_defeated</code> is redundant,
                as the shop's logic only depends on the *count* of defeated
                monsters, not which specific ones.

          <p>
            Consider the same game description from the previous questions. We
            want to write a docstring for our
            <code>select_monster()</code> function. Which of the following

            <ul>
              <li>
                The docstring should accurately describe the function's purpose
                and its return values. The problem states that the monster's
                "strength and health is random but based on the total number of
                monsters that the player has defeated."
              </li>
              <li>
                Option A is incorrect because it describes generating all
                monsters at once, not one at a time.
              </li>
              <li>
                Option B is incomplete because the monster has both strength and
                health stats that need to be generated and returned for the
                battle.
              </li>
              <li>
                Option D contradicts the game's logic, which requires monsters
                to get progressively more difficult based on the number
                defeated, not drawn randomly from a pre-generated list.

          <h2>Spell Checker Implementation</h2>
          <p>
            Given a word and a dictionary, your task is to find all the
            correctly spelled words (from the dictionary) that are within 1
            letter distance of the word.
          </p>
          <p>The valid operations include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Insert:</b> Insert a single character anywhere into the string
              including before or after the first character.
            </li>
            <li><b>Remove:</b> Remove any single character.</li>
            <li>
              <b>Replace:</b> Replace a character anywhere in the string with
              another character.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The goal is to return a list of spelling suggestions even if the
            word is already in the dictionary (but the word should be in that
            list).
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the file named <code>spell_check.py</code>, your task is to
            complete the code for the functions described in it. The
            <code>small_wordlist.txt</code> and <code>wordlist.txt</code> files
            contain English words, one per line. Your code will be evaluated
            only using the <code>wordlist.txt</code> file on some specific test
            cases.
          </p>
          <h3>Examples</h3>
          <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
          <p>
            <strong>Input:</strong> <br />
            English_Dictionary: ["cat", "cot", "bat", "bit", "bite", "boot",
            "bo", “bot”], <br />
            Misspelled_word: “bot”
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Output:</strong> ['cot', 'bat', 'bit', 'boot', 'bo', 'bot']
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Explanation:</strong> From the word "bot", we can get "cot"
            (by replacing 'b' with 'c'), "bat" (by replacing 'o' with 'a'),
            “bit” (by replacing 'o' with 'i'), "boot" (by adding 'o' between ‘o’
            and ‘t’), "bo" (by removing 't'), and since the "bot" is already
            present in the dictionary return that as well. The function would
            return 'cot', 'bat', 'bit', 'boot', 'bo', and 'bot' as a valid list
            of possible spelling suggestions.
          </p>
          <p>You should define the following functions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>create_dictionary</code>: Input is a file of English words,
              one per line. Output is a dictionary of words as keys. The values
              are up to your chosen implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>words_insert_char</code>: Input is a word and a dictionary.
              Output is a list of words with one character added that are in the
              dictionary.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>words_delete_char</code>: Input is a word and a dictionary.
              Output is a list of words with one character deleted that are in
              the dictionary.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>words_replace_char</code>: Input is a word and a dictionary.
              Output is a list of words with one character replaced that are in
              the dictionary.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>spell_check</code>: Input is a dictionary and a word to
              check. Output is a list of possible corrections.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <b>NOTE</b>: You are expected to complete both the given functions
            and also any new functions that you might come up with for problem
            decomposition.

                >Design Hint 1: Think about using an alphabet string (a string
                with all the English characters occurring once). Also, consider
                which words might be formed if you used each character from that
                string.</i
              >
              The only characters you need to consider for this problem are the
              26 <b>lowercase</b> letters a-z. No numbers, uppercase letters, or
              special characters are necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hint #2: For <code>words_delete_char</code>
              <i>Think about where you can omit or "skip" a character</i>
            </li>
            <li>
              Hint #3: In the final <code>spell_check</code> function, consider
              how you can handle duplicate words (spelling suggestions) as your
              implementation may create duplicates depending on your problem
              decomposition. <b>DO NOT</b> remove duplicates in the three
              intermediate functions <code>words_insert_char</code>,
              <code>words_delete_char</code>, and
              <code>words_replace_char</code>.
