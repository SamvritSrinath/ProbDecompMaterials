          <h2>Problem Decomposition for Student Data Processing</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Scenario:</strong> Consider that you’re a researcher doing
            some analysis on the amount of coursework and the quality of grades.
            You are given a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary
            represents a student. Each student dictionary contains keys such as
            'name' (string), 'major' (string), units (integer), and 'grades' (a
            nested dictionary mapping course names (string) to letter grades
            (string, e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C')). You need to write a program to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Calculate the total units for all students.</li>
            <li>
              Find the average units for students in a specific major (e.g.,
              "Computer Science").
            </li>
            <li>Identify all students who have a particular grade (‘A’ - ‘F’).</li>
            <li>Determine which major has the highest average units.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Question:</strong> Consider decomposing this problem into
            smaller, manageable functions. From the list below, select all the
            functions that would be useful and align with good decomposition
            principles for solving this problem.

          <h2>
            Identifying Decomposition Steps for Complex 2D List Processing
          </h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Question:</strong> You are given a 2D list grid
            representing a Square Matrix of integer values. You need to write a
            function <code>analyze_grid(grid)</code> that performs three main
            tasks:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Calculate the sum of all elements in the grid.</li>
            <li>Find the maximum value in each row of the grid.</li>
            <li>
              Count the number of "encircled" elements. An "encircled" element
              is defined as any element where all its direct neighbors (up,
              down, left, and right) exist within the grid boundaries and have a
              value strictly greater than the element itself. Elements on the
              boundary or with fewer than 4 direct neighbors within the grid
              cannot be encircled by this definition.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The function should return a tuple containing the total sum, a list
            of row maximums, and the count of encircled elements in that
            specific order:
            <code>(total_sum, [row_maximums], encircled_count)</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the principles of Problem Decomposition discussed in Chapter
            7, particularly Sections 7.1, 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6. Which of the
            following approaches or helper functions would be useful in creating
            a well-decomposed solution for parts of this problem? (Select All)
          </p>
          <ol type="A">
            <li>
              Write a single function <code>analyze_grid</code> containing nested
              loops to calculate the sum, find row maximums, and count
              encircled elements all within the same function body.

                >Create a helper function <code>find_row_maximum(row)</code>
                that takes a list of numbers (a single row) and returns the
                maximum value in that row. Assume the row is not empty.</b

                >Create a helper function
                <code>is_element_encircled(grid, r, c)</code> that determines if
                the element at (r, c) meets the definition of being encircled by
                strictly larger neighbors.</b

                handling boundary checks.</b

            <li>
              Create a function that modifies the input grid in place by setting
              encircled elements to 0.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a helper function <code>find_minimum_value(grid)</code> that
              finds the smallest element in the entire grid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a function that modifies the input grid by replacing all
              negative numbers with zero.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a helper function
              <code>process_single_element(grid, r, c)</code> that performs
              multiple checks and calculations for a single element, including
              checking if it's encircled and adding its value to a running
              total.

                >Create a helper function
                <code>is_valid_coordinate(grid, r, c)</code> that checks for
                whether or not a specified coordinate is found within the
                dimensions of the grid.</b
